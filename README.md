## Movie-Recommendation-System
# Introduction:
I have developed a web application for the Movie Recommendation System using Django. I utilized the TMDB API to fetch movie posters and implemented web scraping techniques with Beautiful Soup. The system showcases the latest upcoming and top-rated movies on the home page, creating an engaging and dynamic user interface.

The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from Kaggle, encompassing a comprehensive list of American movies from 1976 to 2021. For the year 2022, movie data was obtained through web scraping from Wikipedia, while genre information was retrieved through the TMDB API.
